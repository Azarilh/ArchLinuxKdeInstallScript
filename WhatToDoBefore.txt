Change keyboard layout with the command 'loadkeys'. Execute the script to see more details on how to (it will not edit your system until the Internet connection test will be made and you press ENTER).
You don't need to install anything, but you need to prepare the partitions.
To do so, you can use 'fdisk', 'gdisk', 'parted' or others. Here's an example in case you want to install only Arch in the drive: (these commands will erase completely the selected drive, ye're advised)

	gdisk /dev/sda
		o		# Create new GPT partition label
		n		# Create new partition
			1				# Number of the partition
			(default)	# Where this partition should start
			512MiB		# Where it should finish, but writing MiB you set the total size of the partition
			ef00			# EFI partition
		n
			2
			(default)
			(default)	# In this case, this partition will use the rest of the drive
			(default)	# EXT4 partition
		w		# All done, this writes on the drive and closes the gdisk program

Now you should format the new partitions: (use fdisk -l to list the partitions)

	mkfs.vfat /dev/sda1		# Formats the first partition (1) on the first drive (a) in fat32 / This partition will be used as EFI boot partition
	mkfs.ext4 /dev/sda2	# Formats the second partition (2) on the first drive (a) in ext4	/ This partition will be used as root partition

Mount the root and the boot partitions:
	mount /dev/sda2 /mnt	# It's important to mount first the root, then the boot
	mkdir /mnt/boot		# Make the directory where the boot partition will be mounted
	mount /dev/sda1 /mnt/boot

And finally execute 'pacstrap /mnt' and wait. Then execute 'arch-chroot /mnt'.
Now execute the InstallArchKDE.sh script.

If you don't have the script in the live-usb Arch, follow these steps:

	mkdir asd
	cd asd
	pacman -Sy git
	git clone https://github.com/Azarilh/ArchLinuxKdeInstallScript
	cd ArchLinuxKdeInstallScript
	./InstallArchKDE.sh
